# loom

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines SvelteKit, Hono, ORPC, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **SvelteKit** - Web framework for building Svelte apps
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **SQLite/Turso** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses SQLite with Drizzle ORM.

1. Start the local SQLite database (optional):

```bash
bun run db:local
```

2. Update your `.env` file in the `apps/server` directory with the appropriate connection details if needed.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `bun run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `bun run check`

## Available Scripts

- `bun run dev`: Start all applications in development mode
- `bun run build`: Build all applications
- `bun run dev:web`: Start only the web application
- `bun run dev:server`: Start only the server
- `bun run check-types`: Check TypeScript types across all apps
- `bun run dev:types`: Watch API and dependency declarations when running an app individually. The root `dev` command already starts this watcher; installation and builds generate declarations automatically.
- `bun run db:push`: Push schema changes to database
- `bun run db:generate`: Generate database client/types
- `bun run db:migrate`: Run database migrations
- `bun run db:studio`: Open database studio UI
- `bun run db:local`: Start the local SQLite database
- `bun run check`: Run Biome formatting and linting
